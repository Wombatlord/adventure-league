# Adventure League

## Getting Started

To set up the environment for development take the following steps:

 1. Ensure you have a python interpreter version >= 3.11.0
 2. Check your pip version is up to date, or just update with `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip`
 3. Create a virtual environment in the project root with `python3 -m venv venv`
 4. Activate the venv as appropriate for your platform/shell combination.
 5. Install the dependencies:
   a. If you just want to run the code and don't need dev tooling, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   b. If you're planning to poke around with the code, then to install the full set of dependencies including dev tooling run `pip install -r requirements.dev.txt`
 6. Assuming that works, you're good to go! Run `python main.py` to start your guild of adventurers.
